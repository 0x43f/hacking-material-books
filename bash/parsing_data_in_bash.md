# parsing data in bash



      Parsing, syntax analysis, or syntactic analysis is the process of analysing a string of symbols, either in natural language,
      computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. The term has slightly different meanings in
      different branches of linguistics and computer science. Traditional sentence parsing is often performed as a method of understanding
      the exact meaning of a sentence or word, sometimes with the aid of devices such as sentence diagrams. It usually emphasizes the
      importance of grammatical divisions such as subject and predicate.

      Within computational linguistics the term is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words
      into its constituents, resulting in a parse tree showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic and
      other information.


      Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of computer languages, referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code
      into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. The term may also be used to describe a
      split or separation.
