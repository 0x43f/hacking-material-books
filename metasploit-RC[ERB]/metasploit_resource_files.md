## METASPLOIT RESOURCE FILES

<blockquote>Resource scripts provide an easy way for you to automate repetitive tasks in Metasploit. Conceptually, they're just like batch scripts. They contain a set of commands that are automatically and sequentially executed when you load the script in Metasploit. You can create a resource script by chaining together a series of Metasploit console commands and by directly embedding Ruby to do things like call APIs, interact with objects in the database, and iterate actions.</blockquote>
